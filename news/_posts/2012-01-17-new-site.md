title: Announcing a Documentation Overhaul
author: Antoni Batchelli

The documentation on Pallet has been lagging behind its code base.
This was partially due to a high rate of change, and to our focus on
the platform itself.

Today, we are happy to announce a new documentation infrastructure
that is the base for this documentation overhaul: a collaboratively
edited website for Pallet. This infrastructure will make creating and
adding manuals, development tips, FAQs and how-tos very easy for
everyone. We are also committed to leading this effort by creating the
bulk of the documentation. We welcome any help.

As part of this effort we are:

- Building this website with a setup that allows it to be
  collaboratively edited
  [via GitHub](http://github.com/pallet/pallet.github.com) and using
  Markdown.
  
- Making [palletops.com/doc](http://palletops.com/doc) the canonical
  documentation repository for Pallet. On this note, we are also
  removing any other documentation that we have outside this site to
  ensure that everyone is accessing this most up-to-date version.
  
- Finally, we are creating RSS feeds for news, documentation updates
  and events so that you can keep track of what is new in Pallet-land.

This effort is iterative and we will be adding new features to this
site every few days in the upcoming weeks. You can follow these
updates [in our News page](http://palletops.com/news) or by
subscribing to either our
[News RSS feed](http://palletops.com/news/atom.xml) or our
[General RSS feed](http://palletops.com/atom.xml).

We welcome [any feedback](mailto:contact@palletops.com) and help in
this effort. Stay tuned for instructions on how you can help!
